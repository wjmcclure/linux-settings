# linux-settings

These are files for setting various things up for my vim+LaTeX setup. It primarily relies on vimtex and UltiSnips, and is largely copied from Gilles Castel's excellent files (also available on github!) with some tweaks that helped me set up.

These .txt files are copies of the actual dot files, which I was unable to upload. The text contained within should be copied to the following files:

vimrc.txt -> .vimrc

Xresources.txt -> .Xresources

texsnippets.txt -> tex.snippets

These files do not all belong in the same place. Google around!
